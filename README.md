# CompletePiSSTV

Automated install of a number of packages for SSTV on a Raspberry Pi.

Run install.sh on a reasonably vanilla Raspbian installation. It's a rather
messy script because it was all hacked together, but it should work.

## Packages
This script automates installation of
* Pi-FM-RDS (Generate FM singal on Pi GPIO 4)
* PiSSTV (Converts image from camera into chosen SSTV mode)
